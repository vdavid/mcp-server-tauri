### Checking Available Devices

Before running your app on mobile, check what devices are available:

  "tool": "tauri_list_devices"
}
```

### Mobile Development Workflow

1. Use `tauri_list_devices` to see available emulators/simulators
2. Use your terminal or IDE to run `tauri android dev` or `tauri ios dev`
3. Use `tauri_driver_session` to connect to the running app
4. Use `tauri_read_logs` with source `android` or `ios` to debug issues
