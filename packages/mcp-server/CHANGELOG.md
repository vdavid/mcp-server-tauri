### Fixed
- Handle WebSocket disconnects reliably during port scanning by always cleaning up `PluginClient` connections
- Prevent uncaught exceptions from orphaned WebSocket error events by adding default error handler
- Reject pending requests when WebSocket connection closes unexpectedly
- Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff (max 30s) instead of fixed retry limit
- Handle MCP server connection errors gracefully (broken pipe, EPIPE)
- Improve `execute_js` timeout coordination (7s client timeout vs 5s Rust timeout)

### Changed
